# Task Flow

## Workflow: Shogun → Karo → Ashigaru

```
Lord: command → Shogun: write YAML → inbox_write → Karo: decompose → inbox_write → Ashigaru: execute → report YAML → inbox_write → Karo: update dashboard → Shogun: read dashboard
```

## Status Reference (Single Source)

Status is defined per YAML file type. **Keep it minimal. Simple is best.**

Fixed status set (do not add casually):
- `queue/shogun_to_karo.yaml`: `pending`, `in_progress`, `done`, `cancelled`
- `queue/tasks/ashigaruN.yaml`: `assigned`, `blocked`, `done`, `failed`
- `queue/tasks/pending.yaml`: `pending_blocked`
- `queue/ntfy_inbox.yaml`: `pending`, `processed`

Do NOT invent new status values without updating this section.

### Command Queue: `queue/shogun_to_karo.yaml`

Meanings and allowed/forbidden actions (short):

- `pending`: not acknowledged yet
  - Allowed: Karo reads and immediately ACKs (`pending → in_progress`)
  - Forbidden: dispatching subtasks while still `pending`

- `in_progress`: acknowledged and being worked
  - Allowed: decompose/dispatch/collect/consolidate
  - Forbidden: moving goalposts (editing acceptance_criteria), or marking `done` without meeting all criteria

- `done`: complete and validated
  - Allowed: read-only (history)
  - Forbidden: editing old cmd to "reopen" (use a new cmd instead)

- `cancelled`: intentionally stopped
  - Allowed: read-only (history)
  - Forbidden: continuing work under this cmd (use a new cmd instead)

**Karo rule (ack fast)**:
- The moment Karo starts processing a cmd (after reading it), update that cmd status:
  - `pending` → `in_progress`
  - This prevents "nobody is working" confusion and stabilizes escalation logic.

### Ashigaru Task File: `queue/tasks/ashigaruN.yaml`

Meanings and allowed/forbidden actions (short):

- `assigned`: start now
  - Allowed: assignee ashigaru executes and updates to `done/failed` + report + inbox_write
  - Forbidden: other agents editing that ashigaru YAML

- `blocked`: do NOT start yet (prereqs missing)
  - Allowed: Karo unblocks by changing to `assigned` when ready, then inbox_write
  - Forbidden: nudging or starting work while `blocked`

- `done`: completed
  - Allowed: read-only; used for consolidation
  - Forbidden: reusing task_id for redo (use redo protocol)

- `failed`: failed with reason
  - Allowed: report must include reason + unblock suggestion
  - Forbidden: silent failure

Note:
- Normally, "idle" is a UI state (no active task), not a YAML status value.
- Exception (placeholder only): `status: idle` is allowed **only** when `task_id: null` (clean start template written by `launch.sh --clean`).
  - In that state, the file is a placeholder and should be treated as "no task assigned yet".

### Pending Tasks (Karo-managed): `queue/tasks/pending.yaml`

- `pending_blocked`: holding area; **must not** be assigned yet
  - Allowed: Karo moves it to an `ashigaruN.yaml` as `assigned` after prerequisites complete
  - Forbidden: pre-assigning to ashigaru before ready

### NTFY Inbox (Lord phone): `queue/ntfy_inbox.yaml`

- `pending`: needs processing
  - Allowed: Shogun processes and sets `processed`
  - Forbidden: leaving it pending without reason

- `processed`: processed; keep record
  - Allowed: read-only
  - Forbidden: flipping back to pending without creating a new entry

## Immediate Delegation Principle (Shogun)

**Delegate to Karo immediately and end your turn** so the Lord can input next command.

```
Lord: command → Shogun: write YAML → inbox_write → END TURN
                                        ↓
                                  Lord: can input next
                                        ↓
                              Karo/Ashigaru: work in background
                                        ↓
                              dashboard.md updated as report
```

## Event-Driven Wait Pattern (Karo)

**After dispatching all subtasks: STOP.** Do not launch background monitors or sleep loops.

```
Step 7: Dispatch cmd_N subtasks → inbox_write to ashigaru
Step 8: check_pending → if pending cmd_N+1, process it → then STOP
  → Karo becomes idle (prompt waiting)
Step 9: Ashigaru completes → inbox_write karo → watcher nudges karo
  → Karo wakes, scans reports, acts
```

**Why no background monitor**: inbox_watcher.sh detects ashigaru's inbox_write to karo and sends a nudge. This is true event-driven. No sleep, no polling, no CPU waste.

**Karo wakes via**: inbox nudge from ashigaru report, shogun new cmd, or system event. Nothing else.

## "Wake = Full Scan" Pattern

Claude Code cannot "wait". Prompt-wait = stopped.

1. Dispatch ashigaru
2. Say "stopping here" and end processing
3. Ashigaru wakes you via inbox
4. Scan ALL report files (not just the reporting one)
5. Assess situation, then act

## Report Scanning (Communication Loss Safety)

On every wakeup (regardless of reason), scan ALL `queue/reports/ashigaru*_report.yaml`.
Cross-reference with dashboard.md — process any reports not yet reflected.

**Why**: Ashigaru inbox messages may be delayed. Report files are already written and scannable as a safety net.

## Foreground Block Prevention (24-min Freeze Lesson)

**Karo blocking = entire army halts.** On 2026-02-06, foreground `sleep` during delivery checks froze karo for 24 minutes.

**Rule: NEVER use `sleep` in foreground.** After dispatching tasks → stop and wait for inbox wakeup.

| Command Type | Execution Method | Reason |
|-------------|-----------------|--------|
| Read / Write / Edit | Foreground | Completes instantly |
| inbox_write.sh | Foreground | Completes instantly |
| `sleep N` | **FORBIDDEN** | Use inbox event-driven instead |
| tmux capture-pane | **FORBIDDEN** | Read report YAML instead |

### Dispatch-then-Stop Pattern

```
✅ Correct (event-driven):
  cmd_008 dispatch → inbox_write ashigaru → stop (await inbox wakeup)
  → ashigaru completes → inbox_write karo → karo wakes → process report

❌ Wrong (polling):
  cmd_008 dispatch → sleep 30 → capture-pane → check status → sleep 30 ...
```

## Timestamps

**Always use `date` command.** Never guess.
```bash
date "+%Y-%m-%d %H:%M"       # For dashboard.md
date "+%Y-%m-%dT%H:%M:%S"    # For YAML (ISO 8601)
```

## Pre-Commit Gate (CI-Aligned)

Rule:
- Run the same checks as GitHub Actions *before* committing.
- Only commit when checks are OK.
- Ask the Lord before any `git push`.

Minimum local checks:
```bash
# Unit tests (same as CI)
bats tests/*.bats tests/unit/*.bats

# Instruction generation must be in sync (same as CI "Build Instructions Check")
bash scripts/build_instructions.sh
git diff --exit-code instructions/generated/
```
